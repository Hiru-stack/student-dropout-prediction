# ðŸŽ“ Student Dropout Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of students dropping out based on academic, demographic, and socioeconomic factors. By leveraging machine learning models, we provide insights that can help educational institutions identify at-risk students and take proactive interventions.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict student dropout risk.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Google Colab
- **Techniques**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training & evaluation
- **Outcome**: Identified key dropout predictors with strong classification performance.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Features

- Data exploration & visualization
- Handling missing values & categorical encoding
- Training multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC
- Model comparison
